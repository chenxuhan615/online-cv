          Upon commencing doctoral studies, my academic interests were drawn to the realm of phase transitions and deformations under extreme conditions. I directed particular attention towards phenomena like liquid-liquid phase transitions and glass transitions. I am dedicated to elucidating the fundamental physical principles governing these intricate phenomena by crafting a machine learning potential for a specific material. This endeavor, in its turn, will streamline the accomplishment of large-scale, high-precision molecular dynamics simulations.

          During my master's studies, I extensively explored computational simulation methods, encompassing both first-principles and molecular dynamics. In addition, I acquired knowledge in the realm of machine learning algorithms and neural network construction. Moreover, I conceived and developed a machine learning potential model based on graph convolutional neural networks, details of which can be found [here](https://github.com/chenxuhan615/gcnff). This innovation enabled the achievement of cross-scale simulations devoid of the necessity for artificially constructed descriptors. By the way, I achieved a [GPA of 3.88](https://github.com/chenxuhan615/online-cv/blob/b7ca9b721754e8f817fe7cbadd3ed70f431eb1c0/assets/images/gpa.jpg), ranking first in my class.

          I have earned a bachelor’s degree in Engineering, majoring in Inorganic Non-metallic Materials. My undergraduate thesis revolved around the experimental synthesis and characterization of ZnO fluorescent quantum dots, with the goal of achieving functional specificity in the identification of certain polymer functional groups. This work has practical applications in the detection of pesticide residues.
